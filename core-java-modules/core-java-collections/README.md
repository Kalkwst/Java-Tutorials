## Array List
An `ArrayList` in Java is a class that implements the `List` interface and offers dynamic array functionality. It allows adding, removing, and accessing elements without a fixed size, and offers methods like sorting, searching, and reversing. It differs from regular arrays, which have fixed sizes, and vectors, which are synchronized and thread-safe. For more info check [here](./docs/arraylist.md)
