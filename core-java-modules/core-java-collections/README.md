# Java Collections

## Array List
An `ArrayList` in Java is a class that implements the `List` interface and offers dynamic array functionality. It allows adding, removing, and accessing elements without a fixed size, and offers methods like sorting, searching, and reversing. It differs from regular arrays, which have fixed sizes, and vectors, which are synchronized and thread-safe. For more info check [here](./docs/arraylist.md)

## HashMap

In Java, a `HashMap` is a fundamental data structure that belongs to the `Collections` framework. It allows you to store key-value pairs, where each key is mapped to a single value. Unlike arrays, which use integer indices for access, a `HashMap` lets you access values using keys of any type (such as strings). For more info check [here](./docs/hashmap.md)
